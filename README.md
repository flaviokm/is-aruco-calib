Intelligent Space - Camera Calibration

**ChArUco**

ArUco markers were improved by interspersing them inside a checkerboard called ChArUco. Checkerboard corner intersections provide more stable corners because the edge location bias on one square is countered by the opposite edge orientation in the connecting square. By interspersing ArUco markers inside the checkerboard, each checkerboard corner gets a label which enables it to be used in complex calibration or pose scenarios where you cannot see all the corners of the checkerboard.
